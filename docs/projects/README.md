# Projects

Each **project** groups tasks by scope. Filter by project in the tasks app to focus (e.g. only "tasks-app" improvements).

| Project | Purpose |
|---------|--------|
| **copylume** | Main product: web, api, demo, packages, infra, billing, etc. |
| **tasks-app** | Improvements to this task list app itself. Add tasks here when you want to work on the tasks app without mixing with main backlog. |

One .md per project can describe scope or roadmap; task details live in `../details/` as usual.
