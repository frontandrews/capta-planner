# Legacy reference docs

This folder is for **reference only**. Older tasks in `index.yaml` may have an `appendix` field pointing to sections in these plans.

- **NEXT_STEPS_PLAN.md** — `../../NEXT_STEPS_PLAN.md` (in `docs/technical/`)
- **NEXT_STEPS_BY_AREA.md** — `../../NEXT_STEPS_BY_AREA.md`
- **NEXT_STEPS.md** — `../../NEXT_STEPS.md`

New tasks should use **project** (e.g. `project: primary-app` or `project: tasks-app`) and **details/** markdown files instead of appendix refs. See `../README.md` for the current task system.
