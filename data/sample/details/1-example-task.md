# Task 1: Example task (todo)

## Summary

A sample task to show the planner UI. Edit in data/sample/details/.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Replace this with your own task content
- [ ] Use the same YAML schema as `index.yaml` (see task-schema.json)
- [ ] Details files live in `details/` as `{id}-slug.md`

## Notes

This is **shareable demo data** so the repo runs out of the box. For your own tasks, use a separate data dir (e.g. `data/tasks` or `data/projects/my-project`) and set `PLANNER_DATA_DIR`. See README and docs/DATA_ORGANIZATION.md.
